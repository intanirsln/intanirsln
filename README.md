- 👋 Hi, I’m @intanirsln
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. Some of them are music, read, discovering a new things, learn a new things, and many more. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about a business ethics. I currently read a book called "There's No Such Thing As Business Ethics". From that book i learn that there is a "Golden Rule" that maybe we as a human being have to applied this rule in our daily life. Because this rule is about how to treat others the way we want to be treated. so, if you want to be respected by others, we have to respect others too. Dont hurt people if you dont want to be hurt the same way. 
From that book i discovered that there is a company that applied this golden rule in their company. When a company have a low income, some of them have to cut off their workers so the company not go bankrupt. Thats not happening in this one company.
When this company have low income, the boss still paid the workers as usual but they will puts the leaders sallary suspansion plan into effect. This company really valued their workers. This is just one case that i got from that book.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on human resources or a campaign
